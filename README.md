## Project Description

Our team developed an app on Xcode that uses nearby interaction to track other users that are on the app and on the same network. This network can be based on bluetooth or wifi connectivity, depending on availability of the network itself. Users can make an account using their first and last names, along with their major, for other users to see and potentially connect with them. When two users connect with each other, their pinpointed location and direction they're located in is revealed to the each other, allowing them to meet up and become friends.

Our implementation involved complex concepts like MultiPure Connectivity and Nearby Interaction, but also included simple concepts like User Defaults. We split the work in a manner that handles both back end and front end requirements, where the user interface played a played a significant part, but so did the actual swift implementation.

We want to use it to get people to meet people outside of their classrooms, which is what this app can help with. Something we can implement in the future is a messaging feature, or a feature that shows a description of the other user's name and major, but as of now we stuck with the basic functionalities<br />
